- ToGoFunction / ToGoStruct error checking (what happens to the other To* and Check* functions when called on the wrong type?)
- testing (DoFile, DoString on error)
- lua.go: Dump implementing lua_dump
- lua.go: Load implementing lua_load
- AtPanic slightly broken when nil is passed, if we think passing nil has value to extract the current atpanic function we should also make sure it doesn't break everything
- threads implementation is probably fucked completely should look into it
- lauxlib.go:CheckOption is not implemented
